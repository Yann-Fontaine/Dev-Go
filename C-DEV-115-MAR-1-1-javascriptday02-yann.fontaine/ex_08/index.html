            <p>HTML is a markup language and somewhat like XML, but it does not offer you clear validation like XML.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It is very lengthy do display simple things. They tried to fix this a bit with XHTML, but it got dropped and HTML 5 does little to nothing in that regard.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>CSS is a style language, but it is very complicated to do even simple styles in it.</p>
